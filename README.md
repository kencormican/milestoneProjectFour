## Purpose

Winter sports such as Skiing & Snowboarding have become increasingly popular within Ireland over the past two decades.   
With that in mind I've decided to make the sale of Ski and Snowboard related goods the focus of this ecommerce website.

In doing so I hope the provide a positive user experience that utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python, Django, Heroku, Postgres & Stripe and demonstrates the skills I've developed under the tutelage of the Code Institute team while studying the Diploma in Full Stack Development.
Time permitting, in addition to the above I'm also hoping to capture some of the backend validation and redundancy described, in particular during the Webhooks tutorials.

## Project Brief

The brief was to create a full-stack site based around the business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
The developer is tasked with providing an authentication mechanism and paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.  
In creating the site, the developer should expose the learnings from the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django & Relational Database Modules. 


1. Design, develop and implement a full stack web application, with a relational database, using the Django/Python full stack MVC framework and related contemporary technologies.
2. Design and implement a relational data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate relational data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain.
3. Identify and apply authorisation, authentication and permission features in a full stack web application solution.
4. Design, develop and integrate an e-commerce payment system in a cloud-hosted full stack web application.
5. Document the development process through a git based version control system and deploy the full application to a cloud hosting platform.
6. Test the application through the development, implementation and deployment stages.
7. Deploy a final version of the full-stack application code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. Heroku) and test to ensure it matches the development version .
8. Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system.

# User Experience (UX)

# Strategy

Use the Bootstrap and Django Frameworks, in conjunction with Postgres and the Stripe API to render a clean, robust fully functional ecommerce site.  
The Website should be responsive, allowing end users to purchase goods, register to the site and perform the full set of CRUD operations on their shopping baskets.
The end users should be able to view all products or search based on category, price or rating criteria.
In addition to the above, end users should be able to select individual products to view more detailed information.
Admin users should be able to display, add, edit or delete products or categories.
Site structure and purpose should be clear from the outset, providing the end user with an intuitive learning experience.
The website should be fully responsive and clearly display good UX design for small, medium and large breakpoints.

# Scope

## Preparation
- As part of the preparation for this project I visited  several winter sports ecommerce sites reviewing site structure, theme and content, to gauge how best to approach the design and planning stages. These sites included but were not limited to [Blue Tomatoe](https://www.blue-tomato.com/en-IE/), [Dare2B](https://www.dare2b.ie/) & [53 Degrees North](https://www.53degreesnorth.ie/activity/skiing.html). 

## In scope

- The intent from the outset of the scoping process was to attempt to meet all user requirements and provide additional functionality where possible within the existing time constraints.
- Given the extent of the deliverables and the very tight timelines (submission must be made by end of Jan'21), I thought it prudent to utilise the Tutorial code where possible without making my site derivative. To that end I've decided to create Nine Django Apps - Home, Contact, About, Profile, Categories, Products,  Shopping Bag & Checkout

# Structure

## Application Structure
* A home application used to render the store landing page styled to adhere to the overall site theme.
* A contact application to provide providing a form that will allow end users to contact the store owner or site admin.
* An about application to render site about details.  Note* I created this outside of the home application because, post submission, I intend on introducing additional functionality. The intent is to provide a site admin with a full set of CRUD capabilities for the about page.
* A categories application that will provide a site admin with the CRUD capabilities associated with the product categories. This will be rendered to adhere to the site theme and be wired up to the products views, such that, new categories will be automatically added to a New Offers dropdown in the main-nav.  In addition to the Categories CRUD capabilities available in the application a set of 22 Categories (4 Main & 18 Subcategories) will be loaded via manually created JSON files and the Django fixtures feature.
* A profiles application that will be wired up to the end users order history (time permitting) and utilising the allauth package to provide additional authentication, confirmation and user account functionality.  These templates will be customised to adhere the winter sports site theme.
* A Products app used to render site products & details. Admin users will have CRUD capabilities for all products.  
Again per Category app items the initial set of products will be loaded via a manually created JSON file and the Django fixtures feature.  
Note* as mentioned above, in an effort to use my limited time as efficiently as possible, much of the product code will be derived from the CI Tutorials.  So Thank you kindly in advance Chris!  
I do, however, fully intend to customise the code, style it differently and provide additional functionality where possible.  The intent, again time permitting, is to provide additional stock monitoring logic, and for the Detailed templates some carousel and tabbed views.
* A Shopping Bag application will provide the end user with the ability to add, delete and manipulate bag items.  Again much of the code will have to be derived from the Tutorials.
* The Shopping bag app will be wired up to a Checkout application, which will use Stripe to provide a secure mechanism to make payments.  Time permitting I'll attempt to introduce webhooks and signal functionality to provide additional redundancy.
* The plan is to wire all this up to AWS's S3 to provide static file storage but this may not be possible in the tight timeframe.  As a result I intend to provide a Heroku based deployment using the Whitenoise package as a fallback.
* Re front end capabilities. I intend on creating uniquely styled base templates, navigation and  mobile views as a differentiator.  
* Re backend capabilities I've decided to turn the tutorial development sequence on it's head, deploying the site to Heroku as a first step.  This is followed by development of the Profiles, Homepage, About, Contact, Categories, Product, Bag & Checkout applications in that sequence.  The thought process here is that it will communicate, a decent understanding of the underlying coding mechanisms and how to tie Django applications together.

# Skeleton

## Navigation
-   Having reviewed several online ski shops it appears to be the convention to allow the end user to filter based on gender and age as well as product type. Snow/Skiwear is categorised not only by product type but whether it's targeting Men, Women or Children.  
There are several approaches to achieving this on the production sites, however, I've decided to use a three layer tabbed nav menu on desktop views and a two layer collapsible sidenav menu on mobile/tablet views.  
In maintaining this convention, it is hoped that it will make the site more intuitive for end users.
- In addition to the above I've also used an collapsible search box on mobile/tabled view and a fixed top nav search on desktop views.  
- Finally, in an attempt to, again enhance UX, I've separated site admin and product related elements into there own menus.
- Sign In/Out, Account, and Admin menus will be hidden or displayed depending on whether a user is anonymous, registered, a superuser or logged in.

## Authentication
-	The Profiles app when used in conjunction with Django's inbuilt capabilities and the allauth package provide the site with the functionality to authenticate users, send confirmation emails, reset passwords etc via multiple allauth templates customised work within the sites theme and colour scheme.
-	Jinga if statements, targeting the user session, were used on Sign In/Out, Account, and Admin menus and determine whether the menus are hidden or displayed depending on whether a user is anonymous, registered, a superuser or logged in.
-   Finally, back end defensive logic using @login_required and if not request.user.is_superuser:  statements was used to secure the categories, product and profile views. Unauthorised attempts at access should result in the user being returned to teh login page or receiving an error message depending on whether the offending user is registered or not.

# Surface

## Colour Scheme
-   I felt that a basic light blue theme contrasted against a white background was both aesthetically pleasing and reflected the outdoor winter sports nature of this ecommerce site. 
-   Additional Colour is to be introduced via the poster and images/urls associated with the individual products.
-	Re the Landing Page , I've decided to use a Hero image that immediately communicates the nature of the site and enhances the existing colour theme.

## Typography
-   I've decided to use Roboto family of fonts as defaults with Sans Serif acting as the fallback alternatives.
-   They happen to be my proffered fonts given the crisp, basic styling.
-   I've decided to use Font Awesome icons to highlight functionality and make the site more intuitive.
-	I'll use CSS to customise Bootstrap defaults further. These will include but will not be limited to various degrees of text-shadowing, font-sizes and text decoration
-	Finally, I've used a combination of bootstrap and Jinga methods to alter text capitalisation at various points within the project.

## Imagery
-   The intention was to use Bootstrap card-image components in conjunction with the product image urls to provide a central point of focus for the website. I also intended on using standard Bootstrap card elements, and icons styled with the sites light blue theme to provide secondary points of focus.
-	As described above the Landing Page Hero image is intended to both, enhance the site's theme, and immediately communicate its purpose.
-	A default image poster, is used in the event an admin user fails to select an image during the product creation process. 
-   This poster is be used to populate all empty product card-image elements, thereby maintaining consistency of UX across the site.
-   Finally I've used a rotating Font Awesome Icon as a loading spinner with light blue but transparent background as a loading spinner during the checkout submission process.  I felt it would align with the site them and enhance UX.

## Responsive Elements
- I've used the bootstrap fixed nav and collapse classes to provide a more user-friendly experience at different window sizes.
- I've used a collapsible for mobile and tablet devices and fixed top-nav for larger devices.
- The plan was to limit the top nav to Logo, search, reg/user and Admin elements.
- The Delivery info bar will display above or below the Top Nav elements depending on whether the breakpoint is small or large, with bootstraps d-none and d-block helper classes used to achieve same.
- The Main nav is then  used to extend functionality associated with the sales process to the end user.
- The Bootstrap grid system was also used to render Card Images differently for the Products and Categories pages at different breakpoints. A single card was displayed at small breakpoint, with that increasing to 2x, 3x and 4x cards and at the medium, large and XL breakpoints respectively.
-	Several form button elements and input elements were altered to render more cleanly between large and small window sizes.


## Interactive Elements
-   The Bootstrap framework was used to provides a multitude of interactive features for this site.
-	These included but were not limited to carousels, button and text helper classes, modals, form validation, toast notifications, data toggles, collapse menus, interactive tab menus and dropdowns.
-   Product details will display Stock volumes or out of stock depending on database quantity.
-   Ratings information tags are highlighted as gold if greater than zero, blue-grey if zero rated or as No rating if database value is null.
-   Toast messages were introduced on any page that interacted with a form or where items were added, deleted or updated on the Shopping bag.  Feedback via toast notifications was also introduced for Admin users when performing CRUD operations on the category or products elements.
-	The nav bar was customised heavily to render as intended and for the collapsible, top and side-navs to produce to required interactivity.
-	In addition to the above, search result feedback and form update templates were created, and supported on to backend using python to provide the end user with progress indicators.
-   All form elements are designed to use a combination of Bootstrap and Djangos Crispy forms to provide clean, interactive feedback to the end user.
-   Backend form validation is used defensively to ensure the end user inputs the appropriate information.
-   Interactivity is also introduced through Shopping bag icon and bag total counter underneath it.
-   Finally, don't know whether you call interactivity, per-say, but additional feedback is provided to the end user via backend-email functionality, query notification and order email options as well as redirects to success pages on completion of an activity, order history capture and a feedback loop between the profile and checkout processes.

### Deploy To Heroku

#### Setup Requirements
Make sure requirements.txt is up to date.  
requirements.txt tells Heroku what dependencies need to be installed to run the app.

1.  Goto the Bash Terminal
2.  Type the following: 

```
 pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
3.  Push all changes to GitHub.

#### Setup Procfile
Heroku looks for this Procfile to find out which file runs the app and how to run it.

1.  Goto the Bash Terminal.
2.  Type the following: 

```
 echo web: python app.py > Procfile

```
3.  Open the Procfile, and if there is an empty line, delete it as it can cause problems with Heroku.
4.  Push file to GitHub.

### Heroku

#### Create a new application

1.  Goto the Heroku Dashboard.
2.  Click New.
3.  Select to create a new app.
4.  The Heroku app name must be unique, use "–" instead of spaces, and use lower case letters.
5.  kjc-off-piste-skishop the name I picked for this application.
6.  Select the region closest – In my case Europe
7.  Click create app.
8.  On Resources tab select add-ons, search for Heroku Postgres and select Hobby Free activation.

#### Connecting to the GitHub repository
There are several ways to connect this or any app. You can use Heroku CLI to connect as outlined on the Heroku site. However, it's simpler to deploy the site from Github, 
that way you only need to push to GitHub.

1.  Select Github, from the Deployment method section, on the Deploy Tab.
2.  Make sure your GitHub id is displayed and then enter the GitHub repository name and click search.
3.  Once it finds the repository, click connect, to connect to the repository.

#### Setup the Config Vars
Attempting to deploy at this stage would result in some unwanted application errors, 
this is because we have hidden our environment variables inside the env file, 
and this is not available to Heroku.

1.  Click on settings.
2.  Click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
3.  This is where we tell Heroku what secret variables are required. 
Add the Key-Value pairs as follows: 

KEY		    	        |  VALUE                                                                                                                      		    |
